class neuralEnabledMimoOfdmE2ESystem(Model):
    r"""
    Keras model that implements the end-to-end systems.

    As the three considered end-to-end systems (perfect CSI baseline, LS estimation baseline, and neural receiver) share most of
    the link components (transmitter, channel model, outer code...), they are implemented using the same Keras model.

    When instantiating the Keras model, the parameter ``system`` is used to specify the system to setup,
    and the parameter ``training`` is used to specified if the system is instantiated to be trained or to be evaluated.
    The ``training`` parameter is only relevant when the neural

    At each call of this model:
    * A batch of codewords is randomly sampled, modulated, and mapped to resource grids to form the channel inputs
    * A batch of channel realizations is randomly sampled and applied to the channel inputs
    * The receiver is executed on the post-DFT received samples to compute LLRs on the coded bits.
      Which receiver is executed (baseline with perfect CSI knowledge, baseline with LS estimation, or neural receiver) depends
      on the specified ``system`` parameter.
    * If not training, the outer decoder is applied to reconstruct the information bits
    * If training, the BMD rate is estimated over the batch from the LLRs and the transmitted bits

    Parameters
    -----------
    system : str
        Specify the receiver to use. Should be one of 'baseline-perfect-csi', 'baseline-ls-estimation' or 'neural-receiver'

    training : bool
        Set to `True` if the system is instantiated to be trained. Set to `False` otherwise. Defaults to `False`.
        If the system is instantiated to be trained, the outer encoder and decoder are not instantiated as they are not required for training.
        This significantly reduces the computational complexity of training.
        If training, the bit-metric decoding (BMD) rate is computed from the transmitted bits and the LLRs. The BMD rate is known to be
        an achievable information rate for BICM systems, and therefore training of the neural receiver aims at maximizing this rate.

    Input
    ------
    batch_size : int
        Batch size

    no : scalar or [batch_size], tf.float
        Noise variance.
        At training, a different noise variance should be sampled for each batch example.

    Output
    -------
    If ``training`` is set to `True`, then the output is a single scalar, which is an estimation of the BMD rate computed over the batch. It
    should be used as objective for training.
    If ``training`` is set to `False`, the transmitted information bits and their reconstruction on the receiver side are returned to
    compute the block/bit error rate.
